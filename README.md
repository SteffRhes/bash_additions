# bash_additions

Several custom additions for convenience. Can be loaded into a running bash or added to .bashrc 
with `source bash_additions.sh`.

Or load the content of this repo's file remotely with curl directly into bash (DON'T DO THIS, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
DOING):
```
source <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteffRhes/bash_additions/main/bash_additions.sh)
```
